The files in this repository comprise the source code for creating 
**Reproducible Research with R and RStudio**.

### File Organization

The main files used to create the manuscript of the book are in the `Source` 
folder. This folder contains the parent *knitr* `.Rnw` file in the 
`Source/Parent/` directory. Child documents for the book chapters are in the 
`Source/Children/` directory and child files for the book's front matter are in 
the `Source/FrontMatter/` directory.

### Reproduce the Book

The book can be reproduced by using the R package *knitr*. To do this:

1. Make sure you have [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html), 
and the *knitr* R package installed on your computer. Also install Andre Simon's 
[highlighter utility](http://www.andre-simon.de/zip/download.html).

2. Download this repository and point the directories in the *BookMake.R* make 
file to where it is downloaded to.

3. Run the *BookMake.R* make file in R.

Note: To install the R packages used to compile the book open the 
*Source/Children/FrontMatter/Packages.Rnw*. Find:

```
doInstall <- FALSE
```

in the code chunk labeled "FrontPackageCitations". Change the value `FALSE` to 
`TRUE` and run the code chunk.

**Note:** the LaTeX file will compile with errors and warnings. These are 
related to stylistic choices and should largely be ignored. But because of this 
you will need to **compile the document a few times** to get the full text with 
bibliography and index.

#### Reproducing the Book in Windows.

If you would like to reproduce the book and are using Windows you will need to 
install [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/installer.html). 
Please use the recommended installation to ensure that your system PATH is set 
up correctly. Otherwise your computer will not know where the tools are.

#### Reproducing this Book in Linux

You will need to install the the R packages RCurl and XML seperately. See 
[this post](https://github.com/cboettig/treeBASE/issues/5) for more details.

### Session Info

The current version of the book manuscript was compiled with 
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) (v. 0.98.880 developer build) with the 
following R session:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
